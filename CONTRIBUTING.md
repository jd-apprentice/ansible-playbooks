Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

If you are only going to add a new playbook, you can do so by following these steps:

0. Fork this repository.
1. Create a new folder in `ansible-playbooks/ansible/playbooks/` with the name of the distro you are targeting or just `shared` if it is a playbook for all distros.
2. Create a new playbook in the folder you just created.
3. If necessary, create a new inventory file in `ansible-playbooks/ansible/inventory/`.
4. If neccessary, copy the files you need to the `ansible-playbooks/ansible/files/` folder.
5. Open a pull request with your changes.

Thank you for your contribution!
